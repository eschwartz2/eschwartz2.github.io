    "description": "The human brain, combined with the spinal cord, makes up the central nervous system. The main regions of the brain are the cerebrum, brainstem, and cerebellum. The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain, and has two hemispheres. The hemispheres are connected by commissural nerve tracts, such as the corpus callosum (largest). Each hemisphere is divided into the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. The frontal lobe handles executive functions (planning, reasoning, and abstract thought). The temporal lobe handles sensory input, derived meanings, retention of visual memory, language comprehension, and emotion association. The parietal lobe handles major sensory inputs from the skin (touch, temperature, and pain receptors). The occipital lobe handles vision processing. The brainstem connects the cerebellum to the spinal cord. The midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata make up the brainstem. Underneath the cerebral cortex are structures such as the thalamus, the pineal gland, the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, the amygdala, and the hippocampus."

    "description": "When studying, it’s important to keep a calendar of the many things that you have to accomplish. If you don’t already have a thorough and comprehensive calendar, here are our recommendations: First, mark off the fixed blocks of time that you can’t really change (work, class, significant events). Second, mark off the flexible blocks of time that you want to keep (gym, birthdays, brunch or dinners). Third, mark off the personal blocks of time that you need to recharge (spa, family, alone). Now, there might not be many reasonable blocks of time remaining (if you take into account meals, sleeping, transportation), but mark those as your aspirational study times! If you make it a priority, those times can be turned into progress and growth in the topics and skills that you need to ace this exam! Good luck studying. ~"

    "description": "Often, the best test-takers are the ones who manage their time most efficiently. Skip questions (and mark or guess) that seem out of reach, spend a little more time on questions that you feel confident are nearly solved, and ensure that there’s at least time to attempt every question (so that you don’t miss any 'fast and easy' points near the end). The general rule for timing yourself while practicing is to divide your total study time into thirds. The first third, don’t use any timers, simply concentrate on learning contend and strategies (even if this is slow going). The second third, practice timed, but don’t worry if you miss a few things or still need work (that’s normal). The final third, focus on timing, and look for places that you can gain back a few seconds here or there. A classic example is in Quant: if you could do a single math step (say, multiplication or subtraction) even just one second faster, you could gain back 2-3 minutes of extra time across the average number of steps and calculations in that section. Wouldn’t that be great!"

Oxygen from air is exchanged for carbon dioxide from blood (at the blood–air barrier) between the alveolar air and the pulmonary capillary. Oxygen is diffused into the capillaries to progress through the bloodstream and carbon dioxide released from the capillaries into the alveoli will be breathed out. Alveoli are more numerous in the blind-ended alveolar sacs than at the bronchioles or the walls of the alveolar ducts. Alveoli make up about 90 percent of the total lung volume."

Eukaryotes can reproduce by mitosis (asexually) or meiosis (sexually, gamete fusion). Animal cells are different from other eukaryotes (such as plants), since they do not have cell walls and hence can transform into a variety of shapes."

The cell membrane is a lipid bilayer, with two layers of phospholipids. Cholesterols (a lipid component, not shown) are interspersed between the layers, to maintain membrane fluidity. The membrane also contains integral proteins (green and pink, with hollow cores) that span the membrane and serve as membrane transporters, and glycolipids embedded in the outer lipid layer (orange, branched structures) that facilitate interaction with the cell's environment. The cell membrane is selectively permeable to ions and organic molecules, so controls the movement of substances in and out of cells and organelles through diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport mechanisms."

Cell division by mitosis creates genetically identical daughter cells, with exactly the same total number of chromosomes (one round of equational division). You can remember mitosis has ‘to’ right in the name = two daughter cells created. Contrastingly, meiosis divides germ cells in sexually-reproducing organisms, producing the gametes (sperm or egg) via a reductional division. Meiosis requires two rounds of division, resulting in four cells with one copy of each chromosome (haploid). Additionally, at the metaphase plate (prior to division), genetic material from paternal and maternal copies of each chromosome is crossed over. You can remember that meiosis has four vowels = four daughter cells created. "

Each nucleotide strand of DNA is composed of a nitrogen-containing nucleobase: cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T]), as well as deoxyribose (sugar) and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined from the sugar of one nucleotide to the phosphate of the next, creating an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases are bound together as A with T (two H-bonds) or C with G (three H-bonds). In DNA, there are pyrimidines: thymine and cytosine, or purines: adenine and guanine."

The developing shoot bearing the first true leaves of a plant is the plumule. For many plants, plumule only develops once the cotyledons have grown above ground (epigeal germination).

The birds vary wildly, between 10 to 20 centimeters (4 to 8 inches) in length, and between 8 and 38 grams (0.3 and 1.3 ounces) in weight. The finches are thought to have through adaptive radiation, wherein species rapidly diversify from one common ancestor.

Temperature regulation can also be accomplished through sweat glands and ducts (white coils). Sensation can be at shallow or deep levels through corpuscles (green round), or nerve fibers (yellow thin). The thickness of skin also varies depending on location.

Both types of cells recognize specific antigens (during antigen presentation), and, once identified, the generate a response to eliminate the pathogens or infected cells. B cells make antibodies, which neutralize bacteria and viruses. T helper cells make cytokines that direct the immune response, while cytotoxic T cells make toxic enzyme granules that directly destroy infected cells. B cells and T cells remember antigens that they have seen, by forming memory cells for each specific pathogen encountered. In this way, an animal is able to have a rapid or stronger response to that same pathogen at a later time."
